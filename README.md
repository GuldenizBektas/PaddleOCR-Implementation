In this repo, I try to fetch texts in an image using PaddleOCR library. You can find the necessary function on their <a href="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR">Github</a> account.

You'll need:
1. PaddlePaddle-GPU (Since I used Google Colab, I didn't have GPU problem.)
2. PaddleOCR library
3. Images in your interest
4. Github repo of PaddleOCR

Every installation guide including above steps are within the notebook.
